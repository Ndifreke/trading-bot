A small contention deviation will catch possible dumps this configuration should not be used with a max and min that targets high increase symbols
this kind of configuration has the potential to bounce back immediately but not fully

A large contention deviation will capture a slow downtrend
We can introduce a concept of contention time and use it to ensure that a large contention does not stay longer than
specified time before deviating or traded. This with large deviation will avoid buying a slow down trend this is know 
to not have the power to bounce back as expected
